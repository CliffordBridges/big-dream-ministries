## Project Intro/Objective
Big Dream Ministries offers studies that help people learn more themselves through the Bible. 
These studies include 
* [The Amazing Collection: The Bible, Book by Book](https://www.bigdreamministries.org/product-category/the-amazing-collection/),
* [The Amazing Life of Jesus Christ](https://www.bigdreamministries.org/product-category/the-amazing-life-of-jesus-christ/),
* [Invincible Love, Invisible War](https://www.bigdreamministries.org/product-category/invincible-love-invisible-war/),
* [Be Amazing](https://www.bigdreamministries.org/product-category/be-amazing/),
* [The Amazing Temperaments](https://www.bigdreamministries.org/product-category/the-amazing-temperaments/), and
* [The Amazing Adventure](https://www.bigdreamministries.org/product-category/childrens-studies/).

These studies are sold in different packages; a set includes several DVDs and a workbook, a unit contains several sets, and a collection is the entire study. 
The broad question we answer in this project is: which customers will purchase new packages, and if they do, how many?
We arrive at an answer using so called Buy 'Til You Die (BTYD) models of customer likelihood of making future purchases, along with ensemble methods (logistic regression and decision trees) to determine which studies will be purchased.

## Project Description
We have Quickbooks data from a live company which is exported as a .csv. 
Data patterns in this .csv were inconsistent due to differences in Quickbook systems used over time. 
A substantial amount of communication with employees of the company was required to clean this data.

Find a list of questions we were asked to answer [here](https://github.com/CliffordBridges/big-dream-ministries/blob/master/docs/Questions_to_answer).

We are currently using machine learning models to predict whether or not a customer will purchase further books in a series from which they have already purchased. 
As an extension of this problem, we would like to predict if a customer will purchase a subsequent series after finishing their current series.
